# Crypto-Currency-Analysis
Bitcoin, Ethereum as well as other cryptocurrencies have evolved massively in the last few years.
Here I have attempted a basic crypto currency analysis on 3 cryptos Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin. Any crypto currency can be used other than these with the code. The csv is taken from the crypto site only.
Did some feature engineering and EDA on the dataset to understand the market cap growth, price fluctuations, etc.
Used regression models to see if the expected returns for a certain period of time could be calculated for the corresponding crypto currency.
